        <h2 class="fw-bold">Our Goal: A Mutually Beneficial Relationship</h2>
        <p>CIS carries a large variety of items in both the Frozen and Dry Grocery area for our discount format stores and food banks.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to always end up in a Win/Win situation on every deal we do. We take every phone call and always try to give a quick response. We buy to own and warehouse the goods– which differentiates us from 98% of our competitors. We adhere to all restrictions and run SAP SOFTWARE which allows us to track every case on every sale from the moment it leaves our warehouse. We are extremely effective at burying “sensitive” name brands and private labels due to our extremely large NON-RETAIL customer base.</p>
